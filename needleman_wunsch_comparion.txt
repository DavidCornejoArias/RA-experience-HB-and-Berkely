# Geocoding with text distance needleman wunsch

This part of the project compares the parts of the cities in locations with the address taken from the 
databaseExtractedAddress. To do so, it measures the distances between two texts and it shows the one with 
the least distance. For example it compares "San Salvadr city" with "Santa Tecla city", "Santa Ana city" and 
"San Salvador city". The code would choose "San Salvador city" and it will show that location.
